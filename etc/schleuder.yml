# Which keyserver to refresh keys from (used by `schleuder refresh_keys`, meant
# to be run from cron or systemd weekly).
# If you have gnupg 2.1, we strongly suggest to use a hkps-keyserver:
#keyserver: hkps://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net
# If you have gnupg 2.1 and TOR running locally, use a onion-keyserver:
#keyserver: hkp://jirk5u4osbsr34t5.onion
# If you have an OS-wide defined keyserver, specify a blank value to have that
# one used:
#keyserver: 
# The default works for all supported versions of gnupg:
keyserver: pool.sks-keyservers.net
