# Use this as a table for postfix to select addresses that schleuder
# thinks belong to it.  This is useful when
# smtpd_reject_unlisted_recipient = yes (which is the default for
# modern Postfix)

# For example, you might dedicate Postfix's "virtual" domains to
# schleuder with the following set of configs in main.cf:
#
# virtual_domains = lists.example.org
# virtual_transport = schleuder
# virtual_alias_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/virtual_aliases
# virtual_mailbox_maps = sqlite:/etc/postfix/schleuder_sqlite.cf
# schleuder_destination_recipient_limit = 1

# it is not recommended to use this table for more powerful
# configuration options (e.g. transport_maps) because it could give
# the schleuder user (which can write the given sqlite database) the
# power to change settings for other mail handled by this Postfix
# instance.
